# SQLInjection
This application is a showcase for mysql injection

# Intention of injectable website

The situation is that company, Daniellas Industrial Bakery has hired a junior developer to create an active internal directory which allow employees to search for other employees. Unfortunatly since this person was a junior employee he made a few crucial mistakes. :) Have fun :)

# How it works

`main.py` - This will serve a `index.html` which is a search bar which will allow a person to search for a name. `results.html` will host the results of the search. It will try and parse this into pretty boxes.
