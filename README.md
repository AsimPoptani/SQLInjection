# SQLInjection
This application is a showcase for mysql injection

## Intention of injectable website

The situation is that company, Daniellas Industrial Bakery has hired a junior developer to create an active internal directory which allow employees to search for other employees. Unfortunatly since this person was a junior employee he made a few crucial mistakes. :) Have fun :)

## How it works

`app.py` - This will serve a `index.html` which is a search bar which will allow a person to search for a name. `results.html` will host the results of the search. It will try and parse this into pretty boxes.

## Where the data is coming from

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/employees-preface.html


## How to set up MYSQL
`mysql < employees.sql` - Install employees
